# WIP
- [X] flatten raytracing loop to reduce divergence between threads
- [ ] write a new kernel for ray traversal in participating media
- [ ] parallelize BVH builder
- [ ] an OpenCL kernel for building the BVH would be cool
- [ ] parallizing the host code would help to take some strain out of the CPU and also decrease the frametimes  :stuck_out_tongue:
